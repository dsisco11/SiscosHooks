# SiscosHooks
A library for hooking into events within the <a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/433340/">SlimeRancher</a> game.

## What?
More specifically, when a user has installed this mod it intercepts certain events and functions in SlimeRancher and then allows plugin developers to register callbacks for and be notified of said events.  
When a callback fires for an event it can have any of it's initial parameters or even it's return value altered making nearly anything possible!  
<ul>
<li>Change plort market values.</li>
<li>Alter entity spawn rates.</li>
<li>Alter weapon functionality</li>
<li>(Soon) Add custom upgrades</li>
<li>Etc.</li>
</ul>


## Installing
Please note that it is the _PLAYER_ who needs to install this mod. Plugins cannot use it unless the player has it installed.  
  
The library comes with an installer which will inject it into your slimerancher much like a plugin loader would.  
To download the installer click <a href="https://github.com/dsisco11/SiscosHooks/raw/master/Installer.zip">HERE</a>.

## "An event I need isn't supported!"
Well too bad bucko.
Nah, only joking. Just create an issue on the projects github page and I'll see what I can do about it.
