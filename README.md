# SiscosHooks

**Please note**  
If you make a plugin that relies on this mod then the _Players_ will need to also install this mod for your plugin to work!

Additionally plugin creators do not need any of the _code_ from this library, they only need to add the .dll file as an assembly reference.  
For more information on how to do this _read our wiki_.  
  

### What?
This is a library for hooking into events within the <a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/433340/">SlimeRancher</a> game.  
More specifically this mod intercepts certain events and functions in SlimeRancher and then allows plugins to register callbacks for those events, even going so far as allowing plugins to alter any of the event functions parameters or return values!  
<ul>
<li>Alter weapon behaviour</li>
<li>Change plort prices</li>
<li>Alter entity spawning logic.</li>
<li>(Soon) Add custom upgrades</li>
<li>And much more!</li>
</ul>  
Read the <a href="/wiki">WIKI</a> for more information.  


### Installing
The library comes with an installer which will inject it into your game much like a plugin loader would.
